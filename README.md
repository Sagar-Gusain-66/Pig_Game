# Pig_Game:
The Pig game is a simple dice game often played by two players. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. 

Here are the basic rules:

# Objective: 
Be the first player to reach 100 points.

# Gameplay:
Players take turns rolling a single die as many times as they wish, adding the rolled value to a running total for their turn.
A player's turn ends when they either:
Choose to "hold," adding their turn total to their overall score, or
Roll a 1, which ends their turn and forfeits the turn total (they score nothing for that turn).
Turn Mechanics:

On each turn, a player rolls the die.
-> If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and their turn total becomes 0.
-> If the player rolls any other number (2-6), the number is added to their turn total, and they can choose to either roll again or hold.
-> If the player holds, their turn total is added to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

# Winning the Game:
The first player to reach or exceed 100 points on their overall score wins the game.
